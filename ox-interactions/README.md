# 👮  OX-INTERACTIONS unsing OX_LIB & OX-Target 👮

This resource is built to allow various interactions utilizing modern assets, enabled for the VRP (standalone) framework. I have added Ox Skill Check to escape cuffs when you are in handcuffs. I have also updated all menu items (that are necessary) to use ox_lib when you click them.

**THE DEFAULT WAIT BEFORE THE OX_LIB SKILLSET SHOWS UP IS 4 SECONDS**

🍀 **CUFFS COMEOFF AFTER YOU DIE IF YOU HAVE THEM ON!**


💻 **Installation**
This is a drag and drop resource. Open your server.cfg file, ensure/start SEM_InteractionMenu, then drag and drop the resource and it should set itself up. Please make sure ox_lib is installed and started before this resource on your server. In addition Ensure OX-Target is installed and ensured before OX-Interactions but after OX-Lib. If you fail to do these steps the menu **WILL** not load properly, resaulting in errors & illtranslateable language for your server to prompt coprehend.
